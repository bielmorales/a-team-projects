# A-team Projects

A projects list that you can search, create, edit and delete a project. I recommend using yarn instead of npm to install dependencies and run the project

## Instal dependencies

`yarn` or `npm install`

## Run (development)

`yarn start` or `npm start`

## Run (production)

`yarn build && npx serve -s build` or `npm run build && npx serve -s build`

## Test

Test is not implemented yet.
